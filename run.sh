# PINN-BCD: End-to-End Data Processing and Training Pipeline
# ==============================================================================
# This script automates the three main stages of the project:
# 1. CSV Processing: Cleans and prepares the final master CSV.
# 2. Image Processing: Generates patches and global images from the master CSV.
# 3. Model Training: Trains the tri-modal network on the processed data.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_pipeline.sh
# or to force reprocessing of images:
#   ./run_pipeline.sh --force-reprocess
# ==============================================================================
